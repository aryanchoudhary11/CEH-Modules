# Introduction-to-Ethical-Hacking

## Information Security Overview

### 1️⃣ Elements of Information Security
Information security is about protecting information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Its core elements are often called **CIA Triad:**

  **1. Confidentiality:** Ensures that only authorized people can access the information.

  **2. Integrity:** Ensures that data remains unchanged or should not be alterd unless authorized.

  **3. Availability:** Ensures that data should be available when needed.

### 2️⃣ Classification of attacks

  - **Source**
    - **External attack:** From outside the organization (e.g., random hacker)
    - **Internal attack:** From someone inside the organization (e.g., disgruntled employee)

- **Nature**
  - **Passive attacks:** Attacker only monitors or intercepts data (e.g., eavesdropping, traffic sniffing)
  - **Active attacks:** Attacker modifies, deletes, or injects data (e.g., malware, ransomware)

- **Target**
  - **Network attacks:** DDoS, packet sniffing
  - **Host attacks:** Malware infection, privilege escalation
  - **Application attacks:** SQL injection, XSS

- **Motivation**
  - Financial, political, personal, or just testing skills (script kiddies)

### 3️⃣ Information Warfare

  - Using **Information Technology as a weapon** to attack or influence an adversary.
  - **Examples:**
    - **Cyber Espionage:** Stealing secrets (e.g., APTs targeting government agencies).
    - **Propaganda / Psychological Warfare:** Spreading fake news to influence elections.
    - **Disruption:** Taking down power grids and communication networks.

### ✅ Key Takeaways

- **Information security** = Protecting Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.
- Attackers are classified by **source, nature, target and motivation.**
- **Information Warfare** is large-scale cyber operations often used by governments or cybercriminals.

## Hacking Concepts

### 1️⃣ What is Hacking?

- **Definition:** Act of identifying and exploiting weaknesses in computers, networks, or applications to gain unauthorized access or perform unintended actions.
- **Key point:** Hacking iyself is **not always illegal**. It depends on intent.(malicious vs ethical)
- **Example:**
  - Malicious hacker breaking into a bank system to steal money.
  - Security researcher testing a company’s website for vulnerabilities (with permission).

### 2️⃣ Who is a Hacker?

- A hacker is a skilled individual who uses technical knowledge to **solve problems or exploit weaknesses** in a system.
- **Types of hackers:**
  - **White hat (Ethical Hackers):** Authorized professionals who test and secure systems.
  - **Black Hat (Criminal Hackers):** Malicious hackers who exploit systems for personal gain.
  - **Grey Hat:** Hackers who sometimes break laws but without malicious intent (e.g., reporting a vulnerability without permission).
  - **Script Kiddies:** Beginners using pre-made hacking tools without deep knowledge.
  - **Hacktivists:** Hackers motivated by political/ideological causes.
  - **State-Sponsored Hackers:** Government-backed hackers conducting espionage or cyber warfare.

### ✅ Key Takeaway:

- Hacking = finding and exploiting vulnerabilities.
- Hackers can be good (white hat), bad (black hat), or somewhere in between.

## Information Security Controls

### 1️⃣ Information Assurance (IA)

- **Definition:** Ensuring that information is confidential, integral, and available (CIA triad) to authorized users.
- **Focus:** Protect data from unauthorized access, tampering, or loss.
- **Example:** Bank systems ensuring customer data is encrypted, consistent, and always available online.

### 2️⃣ Continual/Adaptive Security Strategy

- Security is **not one-time**; it must **adapt to new threats**.
- Involves monitoring, updating security policies, and patching vulnerabilities continuously.
- **Example:** Automatic updates on web servers, AI-based monitoring of network traffic.

### 3️⃣ Defense-in-Depth

- **Layered security approach:** multiple defenses at different levels.
- Layers can include:
  - Firewalls (network)
  - Anti-malware (endpoint)
  - Multi-factor authentication (user access)
  - Encryption (data protection)

- **Example:** Even if a hacker bypasses a firewall, endpoint security and encryption protect the data.

### 4️⃣ What is Risk?

- **Definition:** The possibility that a threat exploits a vulnerability, causing harm.
- Formula (simplified):
```
Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact
```
- **Example:** A server running outdated software is vulnerable; a hacker exploits it → potential financial loss.

### 5️⃣ Risk Management

- Process to **identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks**.
- Steps:
  1. Identify assets and threats
  2. Assess vulnerabilities
  3. Determine likelihood and impact
  4. Apply countermeasures
  5. Monitor & review

- **Example:** Patching software, applying firewalls, backup plans, disaster recovery.

### 6️⃣ Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

- **Definition:** Information about cyber threats used to defend proactively.
- Includes data on attacker tactics, malware signatures, vulnerabilities, etc.
- **Example:** Security team receives CTI reports on new ransomware targeting Windows servers.

### 7️⃣ Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

**1. Planning & Direction:** Define what threats to monitor.

**2. Collection:** Gather raw threat data (logs, open sources, feeds).

**3. Processing:** Organize and filter data.

**4. Analysis:** Identify patterns, TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures).

**5. Dissemination:** Share actionable intelligence with stakeholders.

**6. Feedback:** Review and improve intelligence.

### 8️⃣ Threat Modeling

- **Definition:** Visualizing potential threats to identify vulnerabilities before attacks happen.
- Tools: STRIDE, PASTA, attack trees.
- **Example:** Map your web app → identify SQL injection, XSS → prioritize fixes.

### 9️⃣ Incident Management

- **Definition:** Policies and procedures to **detect, report, and respond** to security incidents.
- **Example:** Security team monitors logs, detects unauthorized access, and alerts admin.

### 1️⃣0️⃣ Incident Handling and Response

- **Steps (IR process):**
  
  **1. Preparation** → Tools, access, playbooks ready

  **2. Identification** → Detect the incident

  **3. Containment** → Stop spread of attack

  **4. Eradication** → Remove malware or vulnerabilities

  **5. Recovery** → Restore systems safely

  **6. Lessons Learned** → Improve defenses

- **Example:** Responding to a ransomware attack by isolating infected machines, restoring backups.

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Role of AI and ML in Cybersecurity

- AI/ML helps analyze huge datasets quickly, detect anomalies, and predict attacks.
- Tasks AI/ML can help with:
  - Intrusion detection
  - Malware detection
  - Network traffic anomaly detection
  - Threat intelligence analysis

### 1️⃣2️⃣ How AI and ML Prevent Cyber Attacks

- **Real-time monitoring:** AI detects unusual login patterns or data transfers.
- **Predictive defense:** ML predicts potential vulnerabilities before exploitation.
- **Automation:** AI automates routine security tasks (e.g., patching, alerts).
- **Example:** A system using ML flags multiple failed login attempts from unusual countries → triggers MFA challenge or blocks IP.

### ✅ Key Takeaway:

Information Security Controls ensure **proactive and layered defense**. Risk management, threat intelligence, incident response, and AI/ML integration help organizations **stay ahead of attackers** instead of just reacting after damage.
