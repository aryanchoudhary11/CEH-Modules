## Information Security Overview

### 1️⃣ Elements of Information Security
Information security is about protecting information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Its core elements are often called **CIA Triad:**

  **1. Confidentiality:** Ensures that only authorized people can access the information.

  **2. Integrity:** Ensures that data remains unchanged or should not be alterd unless authorized.

  **3. Availability:** Ensures that data should be available when needed.

### 2️⃣ Classification of attacks

  - **Source**
    - **External attack:** From outside the organization (e.g., random hacker)
    - **Internal attack:** From someone inside the organization (e.g., disgruntled employee)

- **Nature**
  - **Passive attacks:** Attacker only monitors or intercepts data (e.g., eavesdropping, traffic sniffing)
  - **Active attacks:** Attacker modifies, deletes, or injects data (e.g., malware, ransomware)

- **Target**
  - **Network attacks:** DDoS, packet sniffing
  - **Host attacks:** Malware infection, privilege escalation
  - **Application attacks:** SQL injection, XSS

- **Motivation**
  - Financial, political, personal, or just testing skills (script kiddies)

### 3️⃣ Information Warfare

  - Using **Information Technology as a weapon** to attack or influence an adversary.
  - **Examples:**
    - **Cyber Espionage:** Stealing secrets (e.g., APTs targeting government agencies).
    - **Propaganda / Psychological Warfare:** Spreading fake news to influence elections.
    - **Disruption:** Taking down power grids and communication networks.

### ✅ Key Takeaways

- **Information security** = Protecting Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.
- Attackers are classified by **source, nature, target and motivation.**
- **Information Warfare** is large-scale cyber operations often used by governments or cybercriminals.
